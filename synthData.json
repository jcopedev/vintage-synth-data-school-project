Designed to simulate bass guitars, it was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. However, cheap second-hand units were adopted by electronic musicians, and its \"squelching\" or \"chirping\" sound became a foundation of electronic dance music genres such as acid house, Chicago house and techno. It has inspired numerous clones."},

The Juno-106 was the third model in Roland's Juno series of analog synthesizers following the Roland Juno-6 and Roland Juno-60, with whom the Juno-106 shared many common features and components, with the notable differences of MIDI connectivity and more than double the patch storage, all housed in a cosmetically updated modernized chassis. The Juno-106 was Roland's best-selling synthesizer until its numbers were surpassed by those of the D-50 later the same decade."},

The Jupiter-8 was Roland's flagship synthesizer for the first half of the 1980s. Although it lacked the soon-to-be standard of MIDI control, later model Jupiter-8s did include Roland's proprietary DCB interface. The Jupiter-8 had many advanced features for its time, including the ability to split the keyboard into two zones with a separate patch active on each zone."},

It was one of the first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns. Unlike its nearest competitor at the time, the more expensive Linn LM-1, the 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than playing samples (prerecorded sounds)."},
